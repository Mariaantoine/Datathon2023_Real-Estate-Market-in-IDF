# Datathon2023_Real-Estate-Market-in-IDF

48 hours to develop a dashboard using #powerbi for open sourced data analysis displaying trends of the real estate market in IDF, prices/m2, credit rates. 

Then develop a machine learning model able to predict the real estate prices in IDF, taking into consideration different inputs (using #xgboost )and display it in a #streamlit interface.

Here you can see a gif-display I've created:
